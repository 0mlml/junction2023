In the world of online gambling games, simplicity often leads to the most addictive and engaging experiences. "Multiplier Mayhem" is a testament to this philosophy, offering a straightforward yet exhilarating gaming experience. This game combines the thrill of chance with strategic decision-making, all wrapped up in a minimalist, user-friendly interface.

# Game Concept
"Multiplier Mayhem" is a game of risk and reward, where players place a wager and then navigate through a series of random tiles, each holding hidden multipliers or traps. The goal is to accumulate as high a multiplier as possible without hitting a negative value, which ends the game.

# Gameplay Mechanics
Initial Wager: Players start by placing their wager. This amount is the baseline for their potential winnings.

- The Grid of Mystery: After the wager, players are presented with a grid of face-down tiles. The number of tiles can vary depending on the game's difficulty level.

- Choosing Tiles: Each turn, the player selects a tile to reveal its hidden value. These values can be positive multipliers (e.g., x2, x3, x5, etc.) or negative traps.

- Multiplier Effect: When a player reveals a positive multiplier, their current wager is multiplied accordingly. For instance, if the wager is $10 and they reveal a x3 tile, their new total is $30.

- The Risk of Negatives: Hidden among the multipliers are negative tiles. Revealing a negative tile (e.g., -x2, -x3) means the game ends immediately, and the player loses their wager.

- Cashing Out: After each successful tile reveal, players have the option to 'cash out' and take their current winnings, or risk continuing for higher multipliers.

# User Interface
The game boasts a clean, minimalist interface that is easy to navigate:

- A simple grid layout displays the tiles.
- The current wager and potential winnings are prominently displayed.
- A `Cash Out` button allows players to end the game at their discretion.
- Visual and auditory cues enhance the excitement of revealing tiles.
